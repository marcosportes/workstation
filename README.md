# My tools and customization for Linux

This script was made for the distro I currently use: PopOS 22.04 LTS. This makes it easy when I need to use another computer or simply format my desktop.


## Tools

I'm currently learning Devops. I automated the installation of tools with the [devopstools.sh](/devopstools.sh). 



## Customization
After installing the OS, the [postinstall.sh](/postinstall.sh) installs the packages and configures what I need.

### CLI

Terminal emulator with [Tilix](https://github.com/gnunn1/tilix/) and [oh-my-szh](https://ohmyz.sh/)

- Font: Hack NerdFont Bold Mono
- Color Scheme: [Gogh Colors](https://gogh-co.github.io/Gogh/)
- Theme with: *Refined or Agnoster*
- Plugins zsh:
    - [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)
    - [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)

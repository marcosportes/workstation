# My tools and customization for Linux



## Tools

I'm currently learning Cloud and Devops. I automated the installation of tools with the [Ubuntu/devopstools.sh](/devopstools.sh). 



## Customization
After installing the OS, the postinstall.sh installs the packages and configures what I need.

### CLI

- Font: Hack NerdFont Bold Mono
- Color Scheme: Earthsong by [Gogh Colors](https://gogh-co.github.io/Gogh/)
- Theme with: *Refined or Agnoster*
